#  Roblox Modular UI Framework

This project is a **modular and scalable UI system** for Roblox games. Designed with clean architecture and performance in mind, it organizes UI control, transitions, and state management into distinct modules for maintainability and reusability.

---

##  Features

###  Modular UI System
- Dynamically opens/closes UI panels using tween transitions
- Tracks currently opened UIs and composite group states
- Supports nested menus and prevents UI conflict with in-transition tracking

### ðŸ”§ Tween & Effect Managers
- `TweenManager`: Handles all UI transitions cleanly through TweenService
- `TierEffectManager`: Adds tier-based visual effects to items or UI elements

### ðŸ“¦ Inventory & Quick Menu
- `InventoryManager`: Manages player inventory data and UI sync
- `QuickMenu`: Pop-up shortcut menu with UI integration
- `TooltipBuilder`: Dynamically generates item/tooltips on hover

### ðŸ§¼ Memory Management
- Built-in cleanup system to manage UI lifecycles and avoid memory leaks

##  How It Works

### UIManager
At the core of the system is `UIManager`, which:
- Caches references to GUI elements within `PlayerGui.Interface`
- Handles UI state (opened/closed) using custom flags
- Supports callback functions for inventory state tracking
- Allows composite UIs to open/close as a group
- Stores original parents of UI elements to restore them correctly

### TweenManager
A dedicated module that centralizes tween creation:
- Animates opening/closing transitions (scale, position, transparency)
- Prevents duplicate tweens by cancelling overlapping transitions

### InventoryManager & TooltipBuilder
- `InventoryManager` listens for inventory changes and updates UI
- `TooltipBuilder` dynamically renders detailed item/tooltips
  based on metadata like rarity, tier, or stats

##  Ideal Use Cases

- RPG inventory systems
- In-game shop/tooltips
- Sandbox/tycoon UI interfaces
- Skill trees, upgrade menus, radial UIs
